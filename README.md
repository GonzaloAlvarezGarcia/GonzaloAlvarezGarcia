## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🧠 [DocuNet AI](https://github.com/GonzaloAlvarezGarcia/graphmind-rag)
**Advanced Graph-based Retrieval System**
* **The Problem:** Traditional RAG systems often lack semantic context.
* **The Solution:** A hybrid RAG application combining Vector Search with **Neo4j Knowledge Graphs**.
* **Tech Stack:** `Groq`, `Neo4j AuraDB`, `LangChain`, `Streamlit`.
* **Key Achievement:** Refactored legacy chains into modular LCEL for enterprise-grade stability.

### 🏗️ [PropVal AI](https://github.com/GonzaloAlvarezGarcia/propval-ai)
**End-to-End MLOps Pipeline**
* **The Problem:** "Works on my machine" syndrome and manual deployments.
* **The Solution:** A fully automated pipeline from training to production.
* **Tech Stack:** `FastAPI`, `Docker`, `GitHub Actions`, `Pytest`, `Render`.
* **Key Achievement:** Built a CI/CD flow that executes unit/integration tests and deploys with **Zero Downtime**.

### 🕵️ [AutoResearch Crew](https://github.com/GonzaloAlvarezGarcia/autoresearch-crew)
**Autonomous Multi-Agent Researcher**
* **The Problem:** High latency and information silos in manual research.
* **The Solution:** An autonomous team of agents (Researcher + Writer) using **CrewAI**.
* **Tech Stack:** `CrewAI`, `Groq`, `Chainlit`, `Hugging Face Spaces`.
* **Key Achievement:** Automated synchronization between GitHub and Hugging Face via secure CI/CD hooks.
